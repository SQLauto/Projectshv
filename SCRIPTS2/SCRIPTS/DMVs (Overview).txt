DMVs are very useful in diagnosing different SQL performance problems.  In general, you will find great resources for looking into any of the following: 

Resource Bottlenecks 
	CPU 
	Memory 
	I/O
TempDB Bottlenecks 
	Slow Queries 
	Bad Plans 
	Missing Indexes 
	Blocking
Index Fragmentation



Here is a good list of the Naming Conventions of the DMVs that are available:

CLR Related 
	dm_clr_
Database Related 
	dm_db_
Execution Related 
	dm_exec_
Full Text Search Related 
	dm_fts_
Index Related 
	dm_db_index_ 
	dm_missing_index_
SQL OS Related 
	dm_os_
I/O Related 
	dm_io_
Query Notifications Related 
	dm_qn_
Replication Related 
	dm_repl_
Service Broker Related 
	dm_broker_
Transaction Related 
	dm_tran_



Main DMVs of interest:

dm_exec_query_stats – performance stats of all queries 
dm_exec_sql_text – returns exact sql for entire batch given a sql handle 
dm_exec_query_plan – return query plan for entire batch given a plan handle 
dm_db_index_usage_stats – displays how often each index is used, show Read Seeks, Read Scans, Write Seeks and Write Scans 
dm_db_index_physical_stats – replace DBCC SHOWCONTIG used to check index fragmentation 
dm_db_index_operational_stats – use to check for index contention and blocking 
dm_os_wait_stats – Used to determine the types of waits (signal or resource that are occurring) 
dm_os_waiting_tasks – Used to help identify blocking 
dm_tran_locks – Used to help indentify blocking 
dm_os_performance_counters – Query Access to SQL Server Performance counters
